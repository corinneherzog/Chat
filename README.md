# Chat
Chat program created for APCS Final Project 2017
There are three ways to interact with the server
1. Using curl command on command line. Test.sh shows example curl commands
2. Java Client. Working UI(SendUI) takes in user input and posts to server. TestGet demonstrates a get request and prints all of the user messages to the console(with no UI).
3. WebClient(in webclient folder). Javascript client runs on browser.
